# High-Value Metal Extraction Using Microorganisms

## Overview

This project explores the extraction of high-value metals from ores using microorganisms, specifically **Chromobacterium violaceum**, which is known for its bioleaching properties. We have designed a custom **bioreactor** to support and enhance the bioleaching process, aiming to extract metals such as gold, platinum, and copper efficiently.

## Objectives

- Utilize microorganisms for **eco-friendly metal extraction**.
- Develop a **bioreactor** tailored for handling the specific conditions needed for bioleaching with *Chromobacterium violaceum*.


## Features

- **Microbial Metal Extraction**: Use of *Chromobacterium violaceum* for sustainable bioleaching.
- **Custom Bioreactor**: Built to maintain optimal conditions for the microorganism, including pH control, temperature regulation, aeration, and agitation.
- **Eco-friendly Solution**: Provides a greener alternative to traditional mining methods.

## Bioreactor Design

The bioreactor is designed to:

- Maintain **optimal pH levels** for microbial activity.
- Ensure **temperature control** within a range favorable to *Chromobacterium violaceum*.
- Provide **aeration and agitation** for even distribution of nutrients.
- Include a **metal recovery chamber** to collect bioleached metals efficiently.

## Future Work

- **AI Integration**: Incorporating AI for real-time process monitoring, parameter adjustments, and system optimization.
- **Optimization**: Improving metal recovery rates through predictive modeling.
- **Scaling**: Expanding the solution for industrial-level applications.

## Technologies Used

- **Biotechnology**: Utilization of *Chromobacterium violaceum* for metal bioleaching.
